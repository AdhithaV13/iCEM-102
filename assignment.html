                <font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold">Sri Lanka formerly known as Ceylon and officially the Democratic
                    Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, is an island country in South Asia. It lies in the Indian Ocean,
                    southwest of the Bay of Bengal, separated from the Indian peninsula by the Gulf of Mannar and the
                    Palk Strait. Sri Lanka shares a maritime border with the Maldives in the south-west and India in the
                    north-west.

                    Sri Lanka has a population of around 22 million (2020) and is home to many cultures, languages, and
                    ethnicities. The Sinhalese people form the majority of the nation's population, followed by the
                    Tamils, who are the largest minority group and are concentrated in northern Sri Lanka; both groups
                    have played an influential role in the island's history. Other long-established groups include the
                    Moors, Indian Tamils, Burghers, Malays, Chinese people, and the indigenous Vedda.[14]

                    Sri Lanka's documented history goes back 3,000 years, with evidence of prehistoric human settlements
                    that dates back at least 125,000 years.[15] The earliest known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka, known
                    collectively as the Pāli canon, date to the fourth Buddhist council, which took place in 29
                    BCE.[16][17] Also called the Teardrop of India, or the Granary of the East, Sri Lanka's geographic
                    location and deep harbours have made it of great strategic importance, from the earliest days of the
                    ancient Silk Road trade route to today's so-called maritime Silk Road.[18][19][20] Because its
                    location made it a major trading hub, it was already known to both East Asians and Europeans as long
                    ago as the Anuradhapura period (377 BCE–1017 CE). During a period of great political crisis in the
                    Kingdom of Kotte, the Portuguese arrived in Sri Lanka and sought to control the island's maritime
                    trade, with a part of Sri Lanka subsequently becoming a Portuguese possession. After the
                    Sinhalese-Portuguese war, the Dutch and the Kingdom of Kandy took control of those areas. The Dutch
                    possessions were then taken by the British, who later extended their control over the whole island,
                    colonising it from 1815 to 1948. A national movement for political independence arose in the early
                    20th century, and in 1948, Ceylon became a dominion. The dominion was succeeded by the republic of
                    Sri Lanka in 1972. Sri Lanka's more recent history was marred by a 26-year civil war, which began in
                    1983 and ended decisively in 2009, when the Sri Lanka Armed Forces defeated the Liberation Tigers of
                    Tamil Eelam.[21]

                    Sri Lanka is a developing country, ranking 73rd on the Human Development Index. It is the
                    highest-ranked South Asian nation in terms of development and has the second-highest per capita
                    income in South Asia; however, the ongoing economic crisis has resulted in the collapse of the
                    currency, rising inflation, and a humanitarian crisis due to a severe shortage of essentials. It has
                    also led to an eruption of street protests, with citizens successfully demanding that the president
                    and the government step down.[22] The island has had a long history of engagement with modern
                    international groups: it is a founding member of the SAARC and a member of the United Nations, the
                    Commonwealth of Nations, the G77, and the Non-Aligned Movement.</font>
